    "* **Norm** - This is short for \"[Layer Normalization](https://paperswithcode.com/method/layer-normalization)\" or \"LayerNorm\", a technique for regularizing (reducing overfitting) a neural network, you can use LayerNorm via the PyTorch layer [`torch.nn.LayerNorm()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LayerNorm.html).\n",

In the ViT Paper, the authors refer to the MLP as \"MLP block\" and it contains two [`torch.nn.Linear()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html) layers with a [`torch.nn.GELU()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.GELU.html) non-linearity activation in between them (section 3.1) and a [`torch.nn.Dropout()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Dropout.html) layer after each (Appendex B.1).\n",
    "* **Transformer Encoder** - The Transformer Encoder, is a collection of the layers listed above. There are two skip connections inside the Transformer encoder (the \"+\" symbols) meaning the layer's inputs are fed directly to immediate layers as well as subsequent layers. The overall ViT architecture is comprised of a number of Transformer encoders stacked on top of eachother.\n",
    "* **MLP Head** - This is the output layer of the architecture, it converts the learned features of an input to a class output. Since we're working on image classification, you could also call this the \"classifier head\". The structure of the MLP Head is similar to the MLP block.\n",

    "\n",

    "To rent one for 30 straight days would cost **$5,760 USD**.\n",

    "This cost (monetary and time) may be viable for some larger research teams or enterprises but for many people it's not.\n",
